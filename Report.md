# Ideas to show Understanding 
## Critique the use of find index instead of treating the object as a dict 
## Not Following the DRY Princible 
        - Critique the lack of use of dependancy injection for reducing the ammount of duplicated code ie : Passing a function as an argument to a function and allowing that function to execute in specific state 
        - the fact that all modules are just one big function
        - Having the same regex used in all uuid operation but not having it in it's own util function ie isUUID(id)
# : The Code is over 5 Years old and doesn't follow Current Programming paradigms 
    - Typescript / JSDOC
    -
